# tickborn-eda
This tickborn eda was performed as part of my Master of Science Capstone in Applied Statistics and Data Analytics. Data were sourced from the CDC and NOAA to develop Tableau visualizations. The data was first cleaned and compiled, which is included for the relevant Python notebook and the Tableau Workbooks are available on request.
